# Record vs Class in C#

In C#, both `record` and `class` are used to define reference types, but they are designed for different use cases.

## üßæ `class`

- Traditional reference type
- Supports inheritance, encapsulation, polymorphism
- By default, compared by reference
- Ideal for mutable objects with behavior (methods)

```csharp
public class Person
{
    public string Name { get; set; }
    public int Age { get; set; }
}
```

## üìÑ `record`

- Introduced in C# 9.0
- Reference type primarily used for **immutable** data models
- By default, compared **by value** (structural equality)
- Built-in support for immutability and concise syntax

```csharp
public record Person(string Name, int Age);
```

## ‚öñÔ∏è Key Differences

| Feature               | `class`                          | `record`                         |
|----------------------|----------------------------------|----------------------------------|
| Equality             | Reference equality               | Value (structural) equality      |
| Use case             | Mutable objects with behavior    | Immutable data carriers          |
| Syntax               | Verbose                          | Concise                          |
| Inheritance          | Full inheritance support         | Supports inheritance (less used) |
| Deconstruction       | Manual                           | Built-in                         |
| Immutability         | Manual implementation            | Built-in support                 |

## ‚úÖ When to Use What?

- Use `class` when you need:
  - Mutable state
  - Encapsulation of logic
  - Full control over object behavior

- Use `record` when you need:
  - Immutable, concise data models
  - Comparison based on values
  - Easy-to-read DTOs or event models
