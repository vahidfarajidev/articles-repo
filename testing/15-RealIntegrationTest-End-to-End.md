# 🧪 Real Integration Testing with a Real Database in .NET

In some scenarios, we need to test our application **against a real database**, not just an in-memory database or mocked repository. This type of testing is often called:

- **Full Integration Test**
- **End-to-End (E2E) Test**
- **System Test**

---

## ✅ What Is It?

A **real integration test** connects to an actual database such as:

- SQL Server
- PostgreSQL
- SQLite (on-disk)
- MySQL

> Unlike in-memory tests, the data is **truly written to the database** and the full interaction with the database engine is verified.

---

📌 ** even if you test with a real database like SQL Server or PostgreSQL, it’s still considered an Integration Test.**  
The key is that you're testing real interaction between components — not mocking them.

## 🔍 Why Use a Real Database?

| Feature                    | In-Memory / Mock      | Real Database           |
|---------------------------|------------------------|--------------------------|
| Speed                     | ⚡ Very Fast            | 🐢 Slower                |
| Accuracy                  | ❌ Not 100% realistic   | ✅ Fully realistic       |
| Useful for EF Core config | ❌ Limited              | ✅ Full validation       |
| Suitable for Unit Testing | ✅ Yes                 | ❌ No, too heavy         |
| Suitable for Integration  | ⚠️ Partially           | ✅ Yes                   |

## 🎯 When to Use It?

Use real integration tests when:

- You need to verify **EF Core configurations** (indexes, constraints, cascade deletes, etc.)
- You are testing **transactions or real SQL behavior**
- You want to validate **Migrations**
- You're simulating **real-world behavior** in staging or test environments

## ⚙️ How to Implement (Example with SQLite)

```csharp
[Fact]
public async Task Should_SaveUser_In_RealDatabase()
{
    var options = new DbContextOptionsBuilder<AppDbContext>()
        .UseSqlite("Data Source=test.db") // Use real SQLite file
        .Options;

    using var context = new AppDbContext(options);
    context.Database.EnsureDeleted();
    context.Database.EnsureCreated();

    var repo = new EfUserRepository(context);
    var uow = new EfUnitOfWork(context);

    var user = User.Create("RealUser", "real@example.com");
    repo.Add(user);
    uow.Commit();

    var saved = context.Users.FirstOrDefault(u => u.Email == "real@example.com");
    Assert.NotNull(saved);
}
```

## 🛠️ Tips for Real Integration Tests

- ✅ Use **Testcontainers**, **Docker**, or **SQLite** to isolate the test environment
- ✅ Always **clean the database** before or after each test
- ❌ Never run them against production databases
- ⚠️ Keep them minimal and fast when possible
- 📦 Run them separately from unit tests (e.g., in CI pipelines)

---

## 🧠 Summary

- Real integration tests validate the **true behavior of your system**
- They ensure **EF Core + SQL + Data Access** work as expected
- They’re slower than unit tests but far more realistic
- Useful for catching bugs that mocks and in-memory tests can’t reveal
