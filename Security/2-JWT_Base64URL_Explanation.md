# Understanding JWT and Base64URL

## What Is a JWT?

A JWT (JSON Web Token) consists of three parts:

```
HEADER.PAYLOAD.SIGNATURE
```

Each part is Base64URL-encoded ‚Äî not encrypted ‚Äî and separated by dots. This structure makes it easy to transmit in HTTP headers and URLs.

---

## Is Base64URL Secure?

**No, Base64URL is not secure on its own.** It is just an encoding method to make data URL-safe and compact.

Let‚Äôs break down this example JWT:

```
eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9.
eyJzdWIiOiIxMjM0NTY3ODkwIiwibmFtZSI6IkpvaG4gRG9lIiwiaWF0IjoxNTE2MjM5MDIyfQ.
SflKxwRJSMeKKF2QT4fwpMeJf36POk6yJV_adQssw5c
```

### üîπ Header (Base64URL-decoded):

```json
{
  "alg": "HS256",
  "typ": "JWT"
}
```

### üîπ Payload (Base64URL-decoded):

```json
{
  "sub": "1234567890",
  "name": "John Doe",
  "iat": 1516239022
}
```

Both of these parts can be decoded by anyone ‚Äî even without the secret key.

---

## Where‚Äôs the Security Then?

Security comes from the **signature** part:

```
SflKxwRJSMeKKF2QT4fwpMeJf36POk6yJV_adQssw5c
```

This is created using:

- Header + Payload
- A secret key
- A hashing algorithm (e.g., HMAC SHA-256)

When the server receives a JWT, it re-generates the signature using the same secret key and compares it with the token's signature. If they don‚Äôt match, the token is **rejected**.

---

## Key Points

- ‚úÖ JWT content is **readable** via Base64URL.
- ‚ùå JWT is **not encrypted** by default.
- üîê JWT security relies on the **signature** and **secret key**.
- ‚ö†Ô∏è Do **not** put sensitive data (e.g., passwords) in the payload.
- ‚úÖ Always use HTTPS to prevent token theft.
- üîê For confidentiality, use **JWE (JSON Web Encryption)** in addition to JWT.

## How Is the Signature Created?

The signature in a JWT is what guarantees that the token hasn't been tampered with. It's generated using the following components:

1. **Header + Payload**: These are encoded using Base64URL and concatenated with a dot:
   ```
   base64UrlEncode(header) + "." + base64UrlEncode(payload)
   ```

2. **A Secret Key**: A private key known only to the server. This is used to sign the token.

3. **A Hashing Algorithm**: Such as `HMAC SHA-256`. It generates a unique signature (like a fingerprint) based on the header, payload, and secret.

If any part of the token is modified (even a single character), the signature validation will fail when checked by the server, and the token will be rejected.

### Analogy

Think of the signature like a wax seal on a letter. Everyone can read the letter (it's not encrypted), but only the person with the original seal (secret key) can produce a valid one. If someone tampers with the contents and reseals it without the correct seal, it's obvious it's been tampered with.

## How Does HMAC SHA-256 Work in JWT?

When creating the signature part of a JWT, we use an algorithm like `HMAC SHA-256`. This process ensures the token hasn‚Äôt been altered. Let‚Äôs break it down step-by-step.

### üî¢ Step-by-Step Signature Creation

#### 1. Prepare the Header and Payload

Convert both to JSON and then Base64URL-encode them:

```json
Header:
{
  "alg": "HS256",
  "typ": "JWT"
}

Payload:
{
  "sub": "1234567890",
  "name": "John Doe",
  "iat": 1516239022
}
```

After encoding:

```text
encodedHeader  = eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9
encodedPayload = eyJzdWIiOiIxMjM0NTY3ODkwIiwibmFtZSI6IkpvaG4gRG9lIiwiaWF0IjoxNTE2MjM5MDIyfQ
```

#### 2. Create the String to Sign

Join the two encoded strings with a dot (`.`):

```text
dataToSign = encodedHeader + "." + encodedPayload
```

Example:

```text
eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9.eyJzdWIiOiIxMjM0NTY3ODkwIiwibmFtZSI6IkpvaG4gRG9lIiwiaWF0IjoxNTE2MjM5MDIyfQ
```

#### 3. Apply HMAC SHA-256

Now we generate a signature using:

```text
signature = HMAC_SHA256(dataToSign, secretKey)
```

- **dataToSign** is the string above
- **secretKey** is a private key that only the server knows (e.g., `"my_super_secret_key"`)

This results in a binary signature, which is then Base64URL-encoded to create the final signature string.

```text
encodedSignature = Base64UrlEncode(signature)
```

Example (simplified):

```text
SflKxwRJSMeKKF2QT4fwpMeJf36POk6yJV_adQssw5c
```

#### 4. Final JWT Token

Now you can build the complete JWT:

```text
encodedHeader + "." + encodedPayload + "." + encodedSignature
```

## üîê What Is the Role of `secretKey`?

The `secretKey` is critical. It ensures that only the server (who knows the key) can create or validate a valid signature.

If someone changes the payload, they can‚Äôt generate a matching signature without knowing the secret key.

### Analogy

Think of the `secretKey` like a stamp only the server has. If someone tampers with the document, they can‚Äôt reproduce the original stamp ‚Äî and the forgery is detected immediately.

## Conclusion

JWTs are not meant to hide information ‚Äî they are meant to **prove authenticity**. While the contents are readable, the signature ensures they haven‚Äôt been tampered with.

Always handle JWTs securely and understand what they are ‚Äî and are not ‚Äî designed to do.
